# distributed-whiteboard

## What is this even?
Another project for my university module CMPCMC34: Distributed Computing. Kinda like the [distributed-pontoon project](https://github.com/hexpunK/distributed-pontoon), but focused on a peer-to-peer system instead of a distributed client-server system.

## What do??
As the title suggests, it's a whiteboard! The program allows users to draw and type messages onto a canvas, this should then be networked to every other user that is on the same overlay network for the application. New users should also receive everything that is already stored on the whiteboard when they connect.

## Can I Help?
No.
